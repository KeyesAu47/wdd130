        <p>Utah is a western U.S. state known for its diverse landscapes, ranging from arid deserts with striking red rock formations to lush forests and snow-capped mountains. Its capital and largest city is Salt Lake City, home to the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which plays a significant role in the state's culture and history. Utah is also famous for its outdoor recreation opportunities, including world-renowned ski resorts, national parks like Zion and Arches, and a growing tech industry in the "Silicon Slopes."</p>
